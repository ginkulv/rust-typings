# rust-typings

A small application written in `Rust` using `egui` library for practicing touch typing. Inspired by [typings](https://github.com/briano1905/typings).

It's conceived to be pinned to the Taskbar and opened with combination `Win` + `n` at any moment.

Hotkeys:
- `Tab` - start over
- `Esc` - close the app
